Rescission of Adjudication of Disappearance
-LRB- 1 -RRB- 
If there is any proof that an absentee is alive , or that he/she died at a time differing from that provided in the preceding Article , the family court must , at the request of the absentee himself/herself or any interested person , rescind the adjudication of disappearance .
In such case , the rescission shall not affect the validity of any act which was performed without knowledge after the adjudication of disappearance but before the rescission thereof .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- 
Any person who acquired any property by the adjudication of disappearance shall lose its/his/her right upon rescission thereof ; provided , however , that such person shall have the obligation to return such property only to the extent he/she is actually enriched .
