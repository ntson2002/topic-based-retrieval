Discharge of Testamentary Donee of Testamentary Gift with Burden
If the value of an object of a testamentary gift with burden is reduced due to the qualified acceptance of an heir , or a filing for recovery of legally reserved portion , a testamentary donee may avoid the duties borne from that testamentary gift , proportional to the reduction ; provided , however , that if the testator has indicated a particular intent in his/her will , that intent shall be complied with .
