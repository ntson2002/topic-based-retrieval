Right to Obtain Reimbursement of Guarantor Not Entrusted by Principal Obligor
-LRB- 1 -RRB- 
If a person , who has become a guarantor without the entrustment of the principal obligor , has performed the obligation or has otherwise in exchange for his/her own property procured the release from liability of the principal obligor , the principal obligor must reimburse the guarantor to the extent that the principal obligor was enriched at the time of such performance of the obligation .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- 
A person who has become a guarantor against the will of the principal obligor shall have the right to obtain reimbursement only to the extent that the principal obligor is actually enriched .
In such case , if the principal obligor asserts that he/she had , prior to the day of the demand for reimbursement , grounds for set-off against the obligee , the guarantor may demand that the obligee perform the obligation which would have been extinguished by operation of such set-off .
