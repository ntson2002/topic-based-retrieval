Refusal by Buyer to Pay Purchase money where Loss of Rights is Likely
If the buyer is likely to lose the rights he/she has bought , in whole or in part , due to the existence of persons who assert rights to the subject matter of the sale , the buyer may refuse to pay the purchase money , in whole or in part , in proportion to the extent of that likelihood ; provided , however , that this shall not apply if the seller has provided reasonable security .
