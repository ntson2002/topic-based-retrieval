Effect of Settlements
In cases where it is admitted at settlement that one of the parties has the rights that are the subject of the dispute , or that the other party did not have the rights , if conclusive evidence is obtained to the effect that the first party did not have the rights in the past , or that the other party did have the rights , the rights are regarded as either transferred to the first party or extinguished at settlement .
