Defense of Demand
If an obligee has demanded performance of an obligation from the guarantor , the guarantor may demand the obligee to demand performance of the principal obligor first ; provided , however , that , this shall not apply to the cases where the principal obligor has received a ruling for the commencement of bankruptcy procedures or where his/her whereabouts are unknown .
