An heir may use his/her own property to make performance to an inheritance obligee or donee , or provide reasonable security , and thereby prevent an application for separation of property or have its effect extinguished ; provided that this shall not apply if an obligee of the heir expresses an objection and can prove that he/she would receive damage from this .
