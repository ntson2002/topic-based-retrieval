Ruling of Loss of Parental Authority
If a father or mother has abused his/her child or abandoned the child in bad faith , or a child 's interests are extremely harmed due to considerable difficulty or inappropriateness in the exercise of parental authority by his/her father or mother , the family court may , at the request of the child , any relative of the child , a guardian of a minor , a supervisor of a guardian of a minor , or a public prosecutor , make a ruling of loss of parental authority with regard to the father or mother ; provided , however , that this shall not apply if the cause thereof is expected to cease to exist within two years .
