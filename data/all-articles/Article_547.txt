Extinguishment of Right to Cancel by Demand
If no period is provided for the exercise of the right to cancel , the other party may issue a notice of demand to the holder of the right to cancel , specifying a reasonable period , to the effect that the holder of the right to cancel is to give a definite answer as to whether or not the right will be exercised within that period .
In such cases , if no notice of cancellation is received within that period , the right to cancel shall be extinguished .
