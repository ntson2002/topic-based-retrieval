Method of Tender of Performances
The tender of the performance must be made actually consistent with the main purport of the obligation ; provided , however , that , if the obligee refuses to accept such performance in advance , or any act is required on the part of the obligee with respect to the performance of the obligation , it shall be sufficient if the obligor demands the acceptance thereof by giving a notice that the tender of the performance has been prepared .
