Effect of Acts Done by One Parent in the Name of Both Parents
Where parents exercise parental authority jointly and one parent , in the name of both parents , performs a juristic act on behalf of a child , or give his/her consent for the child to perform a juristic act , the effect of that act shall not be prevented , even if it is contrary to the intention of the other parent ; provided , however , that this shall not apply if the other party has knowledge .
